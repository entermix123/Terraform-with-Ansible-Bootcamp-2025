47. AWS RDS Basics
==================


RDS - Amazon Relational Database Service
----------------------------------------

➢ It’s Amazon managed DB Solution.
	- Amazon will maintain the complete DB service from backup to upgrade

➢ RDS Manages BackUp, Software Patching, Auto Failure Detection and recovery
	- RD service created on HA mode - high availability mode (services created on 2-3 availability zones, two of them are synced - redundant)
	- we can provide backup plan - when to perform backups and for how many days we want to keep our backup
	- all updates, upgrades and paches are executed by amazon with no service desruption

➢ User have Automatic Backup and manual Backup Options.



RDS Supports below RDBMS
------------------------
	➢ MySQL
	➢ MariaDB
	➢ Postgre SQL
	➢ Oracle
	➢ MS SQL Server

➢ RDS have HA functionality with auto replication.
	- set redundant service on close availability zone, so when the primary service is not working, the redundant service assure the sevice availability - takes the traffic


RDS Auto Scaling
----------------
➢ RDS auto scale storage capacity in response to growing db workload with Zero Down Time.


Steps to create RDS Instances:
------------------------------

➢ Create a Subnet Group - Allow in which Subnets the database will be in.
	- if RDS in HA mode we have to define more than one Subnet, so both of the instance are created in different subnet
	- we need subnet group form more thatn one subnet - private subnet

➢ Create Parameter Group - Allow to change setting in DB using parameters.
	- DB settings are managed with Parameter Group, RDS do NOT allow ssh connection
	- we can manage RDS only from parameters

➢ Create Security group - Allow incoming traffic to RDS instance.
	- we need to grand connection ONLY to the instances that will perform actions on RDS 

➢ Create RDS Instance Itself.
	- when all requirements above are covered, we can create RDS instance


RDS AWS Components:
-------------------
	➢ DB Instances
	➢ Regions and Availability Zones
	➢ Security Groups
	➢ DB Parameter Groups
	➢ DB Option Groups
